                        <h4>H.P. Lovecraft</h4>
                        <p>The cloudless day is richer at its close;
                            A golden glory settles on the lea;
                           Soft, stealing shadows hint of cool repose
                            To mellowing landscape, and to calming sea.
                        </p>
                        <p>And in that nobler, gentler, lovelier light,
                            The soul to sweeter, loftier bliss inclines;
                           Freed form the noonday glare, the favour'd sight
                            Increasing grace in earth and sky divines.
                        </p>
                        <p>                      
                           But ere the purest radiance crowns the green,
                           Or fairest lustre fills th' expectant grove,
                           The twilight thickens, and the fleeting scene
                           Leaves but a hallow'd memory of love!
                        </p>

                        <h4>Edgar Allan Poe</h4>
                        <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!
                            And, in parting from you now,
                            Thus much let me avow --
                            You are not wrong, who deem
                            That my days have been a dream;
                            Yet if hope has flown away
                            In a night, or in a day,
                            In a vision, or in none,
                            Is it therefore the less gone?
                            All that we see or seem
                            Is but a dream within a dream.
                        </p>
                        <p>I stand amid the roar
                            Of a surf-tormented shore,
                            And I hold within my hand
                            Grains of the golden sand --
                            How few! yet how they creep
                            Through my fingers to the deep,
                            While I weep -- while I weep!
                            O God! can I not grasp
                            Them with a tighter clasp?
                            O God! can I not save
                            One from the pitiless wave?
                            Is all that we see or seem
                            But a dream within a dream?
                        </p>

                        <h4>Oscar Wilde</h4>
                        <p>It is full summer now, the heart of June;
                            Not yet the sunburnt reapers are astir
                            Upon the upland meadow where too soon
                            Rich autumn time, the season’s usurer,
                            Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,
                            And see his treasure scattered by the wild and spendthrift breeze.
                        </p>
                        <p>Too soon indeed! yet here the daffodil,
                            That love-child of the Spring, has lingered on
                            To vex the rose with jealousy, and still
                            The harebell spreads her azure pavilion…
